In any business setting, making sense of data is a critical part of informed decision-making. Whether it's tracking sales performance, summarizing survey results, or understanding trends across multiple projects, data analysis often takes time and effort. It's in these situations where the Analyst agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat can help. This prebuilt agent is designed to assist you with exploring, interpreting, and summarizing your work data through your use of natural language prompts.

The Analyst agent acts like your personal data assistant. It can scan data in files you have access to (such as Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and Power BI dashboards) and provide helpful summaries, charts, and insights based on your questions. For instance, if you ask, "What are the key trends in this sales report?" or "Summarize performance by region," Analyst responds with a clear, concise breakdown, often including visuals or summaries you can use directly in reports or presentations.

### Let Analyst do the heavy lifting with your data

The Analyst agent thinks like a skilled data scientist, so you can go from raw data to insights in minutes. It's optimized to do advanced data analysis by using chain-of-thought reasoning to iteratively progress through problems. It takes as many steps as necessary to refine its reasoning and provide a high-quality answer that mirrors human analytical thinking. It can run Python to tackle your most complex data queries, and you can view the code it's running in real time and check its work. For example, you can use Analyst to turn raw data that's scattered across multiple spreadsheets into a demand forecast for a new product, a visualization of customer purchasing patterns, or a revenue projection.

The Analyst agent is especially helpful for recurring tasks like preparing for business reviews, tracking performance metrics, or identifying outliers in your data. It can also help you spot inconsistencies or gaps that might otherwise go unnoticed. You don't need to know advanced Excel formulas or complex BI tools to get started. The Analyst agent understands everyday business language and can interpret your intent. This feature makes it especially useful if you aren't a data expert but still need to work with numbers and reports. It also saves time by automating tasks that might otherwise take hours, such as building a pivot table or creating a chart.

One of the most powerful features of Analyst is its ability to connect data across files you recently worked with in Microsoft 365. If you collaborated on a shared Excel sheet or reviewed a PowerPoint deck with embedded tables, Analyst can reference that content to answer your questions more completely. It also respects your file permissions, so it only accesses data you're authorized to see.

### Sample prompts when working with Analyst

Here's a list of sample prompts you can try with the  prebuilt Analyst agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. These prompts are designed to be natural and task-oriented, helping users get insights from their data without needing advanced technical skills.

- **Understanding and summarizing data**
    - "Summarize the key trends in this Excel file."
    - "What are the top five performing products by revenue?"
    - "Can you identify any anomalies in this sales data?"
    - "Give me a quick overview of our Q1 performance."
- **Creating visuals**
    - "Create a bar chart showing monthly sales by region."
    - "Visualize the customer churn rate over the past year."
    - "Generate a pie chart of expenses by category."
- **Comparing and filtering**
    - "Compare this year's revenue to last year's."
    - "Filter this data to show only North America and EMEA."
    - "Which departments had the highest cost increases?"
- **Time-based analysis**
    - "Show me the sales trend over the last six months."
    - "What was our average weekly revenue in Q2?"
    - "Highlight any seasonal patterns in this dataset."
- **Predictive and what-if scenarios**
    - "Based on current trends, what will our revenue look like next quarter?"
    - "What happens if we increase marketing spend by 10%?"
    - "Forecast customer growth for the next six months."

### Limitations of the Analyst agent

While the Analyst agent is a powerful tool for data analysis and insights, it has a few limitations to be aware of:

- **Requires clear data structure**. The Analyst agent works best when the data you provide is well-organized and clearly structured, such as tables and spreadsheets. If your data is messy, incomplete, or requires substantial cleaning, you might need to prepare it before using the Analyst agent for deeper insights.
- **Can't replace expert data interpretation**. While Analyst can generate insights based on the data, it doesn't replace domain-specific expertise. For highly specialized analysis or nuanced interpretation, consulting a subject matter expert is recommended.
- **Doesn't handle non-tabular data well**. The Analyst agent excels with structured, tabular data, such as spreadsheets. For unstructured data like freeform text, images, or raw notes, it may not be as effective in drawing meaningful conclusions without first transforming the data into a structured format (like a table or spreadsheet). These extra steps might involve summarizing or extracting key entities, such as names, dates, numbers, and so on, classifying text into categories, or parsing information into fields and rows.
- **Requires human review for complex insights**. For complex or critical business decisions, Analyst's results should be viewed as a helpful guide. However, a human should review the final interpretation and decision-making, especially when dealing with high-stakes outcomes.
- **Limited customization for specialized queries**. While the Analyst agent can handle a broad range of standard data analysis tasks, highly specialized or custom queries might require manual adjustments. If you need specific statistical techniques or complex models, you might need to adjust the outputs or perform extra analysis outside the Analyst agent.
- **Not a real-time data processor**. Analyst can process static datasets, such as data you upload to a file, but it isn't designed to integrate with real-time or streaming data sources unless specifically set up. You might need to update the data manually for fresh insights.
- **Unable to automatically detect all data inconsistencies**. While the Analyst agent can help identify obvious data gaps or inconsistencies, it might not catch every issue, especially if those issues are subtle or highly context-dependent. You might need to manually inspect the data to ensure quality.
- **Doesn't replace advanced Business Intelligence (BI) tools**. Although Analyst can perform advanced data analysis, it isn't a substitute for more complex BI tools, such as Power BI and Tableau, for in-depth reporting, dashboard creation, or enterprise-level data visualization.
