In today's fast-paced workplace, the ability to quickly synthesize large volumes of information is essential for making informed decisions and preparing effectively for meetings and presentations. Microsoft 365 Copilot's Researcher agent is designed to support this need by intelligently pulling together relevant content from across Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams. 

This lab offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how the Researcher agent can help you uncover insights, organize information, and generate polished outputs from your own data, all within the familiar Microsoft 365 environment. Whether you're consolidating project updates, gathering stakeholder input, or preparing for executive discussions, this lab demonstrates how Copilot can enhance your productivity and ensure you're always ready with the right information at the right time.

> [!NOTE]
>  This course doesn't include a Microsoft 365 lab tenant with fictitious Outlook and Teams data. Instead, you must complete this training exercise using your own personal data. 

In this training exercise, you plan to use the Researcher agent to synthesize information across Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams to prepare insights on a topic from your own data.

### Exercise

Think of an actual project that you participated in over the past 90 days. Amidst countless emails, meetings, and virtual discussions, you find yourself in need of a comprehensive summary of all communications related to this critical initiative. Microsoft's prebuilt Researcher agent is the perfect tool to synthesize all your communication history and provide a concise recap of all activities.

With a simple command, you can instruct the platform to collate and distill the essence of your emails and chats pertaining to the project over the past month. In doing so, note how the agent effortlessly sifts through the information clutter. It then presents you with a concise summary that not only captures the progress made but also highlights any key decisions, challenges, and emerging trends. This exercise exemplifies how using the Researcher agent can save you valuable time while ensuring you stay well-informed and in control of the crucial aspects of your business endeavors.
